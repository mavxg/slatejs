Document editor based on operational transforms of attributed strings

## TODO

### New

Note, some of these are probably on Qubic not SlateJS

* [ ] Qubic Front Page
* [ ] Table Paste
* [ ] File Embed
* [ ] Cache result diff (don't send every recalc to server)
* [ ] Cache can vary over category(s)
* [ ] History Page
* [ ] Fix cursor for encrypted region
* [ ] Check if caching bug fixed (inline code math test - press recalc)

### Nice to have

* [ ] Async outstanding (probably in Qube)
* [ ] @ format system (probably in Qube)
* [ ] Charts (=Series(label, axis, values))

### Old

* [X] S-Expression document renderer
* [X] Inline selection renderer
* [X] FIX: Selection off by one error
* [X] FIX: Selection fails outside lines
* [X] FIX: Selection unstable under selection spans
* [X] FIX: Selection fails in code
* [X] Multiple selection
* [X] Minimal selection update check
* [X] Keyboard shortcut system *** 
* [E] Table editor actions
	- Merge/Unmerge cells (optional)
	- Selection in single table context check
	- Shift+Space = select row
	- Ctrl+Space = select column
	- Ctrl+Shift+% = apply percentage format
	- Ctrl+Shift+# = apply date format
* [E] Hookup Qube
	- Insert global errors/messages
	- Cache result ops.
* [ ] Render out of date code (i.e. not yet calculated)
* [ ] Copy/Cut (inc table)
	- What does excel do about non rectangular selections
		and cut and paste? Does it merge them? Can only copy selections
		in a table if they line up (same start row and end row or same
		start column and end column). Just get an error if you try to
		copy something that doesn't line up.
	- Ctrl+y = redo last action (can also be used to repeat if the redo buffer is empty)
* [ ] Paste (inc table)
* [X] Scroll to cursor
* [X] Movement commands
* [X] Delete commands
* [ ] Attribute on paragraphs (??? how should it deal with tables
	  - attribute if in vs attribute only if fully selected.)
	  - Tables are shown fully selected so just attribute all the heads
	  - could have an allowable attributes on the symbol
	  	to avoid attributing things like a result with something that it
	  	cannot have.

* [ ] discard nop in livedb caused by _apply exception returning same doc.

* [X] eraseText(region) on doc //just a replaceText with ""
* [ ] Replace should balance missing closes by inserting after your insert.
      and missing opens by inserting before your insert. (or just collapse the
      selection like Google Docs)

# Encryption

Add encrypted section. Generates key which it uses to encrypt the section and then encrypts that with your password based key.

Where should we store the keys? Document object. Server sid

  (encrypted (key "salt" "vhash", "encrypted key") ... encrypted data ...)

  (encrypted (keys {pubid:..., key:encrypted key}) (encd nonce ... encrypted ops ...) (encd nonce ) ...)

  server side we store a users public key and encrypted private key (which we only share with them) ... this way we can separate this out...

# IDEAS

(probably need columns --- before the rows in a table)

* IDEA: lens/scratch sidebar. Show calculations pulled out to the side and how they change
  when you change the model.

### Dependent dimensions

  dimensions: [{name:A, items:[...]},{name:B, items:[...]},{name:C, items:[...]}],
  dependencies: [{dimensions:[A,B], tuples:[[a_i,b_i],...]}],
  values: [...], //length = dim(C) * length of tuples in dependencies

This assumes that you are mostly sparse. It would be a good way to store things in Qube also since most of the code would not need to care about the dependencies. Can also have 3 way/n way dependencies.

### Prefix slice

  //map((a) -> a[P], {A,B,C}) -- provided [P] doesn't change dimensions.

  [P]{A,B,C} === {A[P],B[P],C[P]}

## Bugs

* Encryption squash breaks syncronisation (looks like the bug is in EncrypedContext.proto._onOp)

* x(space) breaks in encryption (e.g. *<space> to list item)

* Delete key at start of row causes row join

* Kerning changes when cursor is between kerned pairs. (Google docs solves this by not kerning text.)

* List items should nest inside other items not at the list level..

* Selection transform bug when overtyping with mulitple selections.

* line up doesn't work from after a freshly created section break.
   or TO or FROM a new line *** IMPORTANT

* cannot delete a boundary over list items (with double indent) or tables. (Note, should delete whole table.)

* replace should adjust selection first.

* Double character insert under some conditions (seems to be caused by critical regions)

* Fast >(space) doesn't trigger key combination.

//TODO: make shouldComponentUpdate part of the friar class so that it can return false if only the selection has changed.


## Long term todo

* [ ] Add bidirectional support.
      Look at how codemirror supports this in their selections.
